Join me, Clayton Kucera, as I painstakingly craft a narrative history of the Franks and their exploits. This audio journey will cover a timespan from the arrival of the Franks into history (~200 CE) until the partition of the Carolingian Empire (924 CE).

__Please bear with me as I become acquanited with podcasting.__
